[Grove - 6-Axis Accelerometer&Compass v2.0](https://www.seeedstudio.com/s/Grove-6-Axis-Accelerometer%26Compass-v2.0-p-2476.html)


The Grove 6-Axis Accelerometer & Compass is a 3-axis accelerometer combined with a 3-axis magnetic sensor.  It is based on the sensor module LSM303DLH which has a selectable linear acceleration full scale range of ±2g / ±4g / ±8g and a selectable magnetic field full scale range of ±1.3 /±1.9 / ±2.5 / ±4.0 / ±4.7 / ±5.6 / ±8.1 gauss. Both the magnetic parts and the accelerometer parts can be powered down separately to reduce the power consumption. The Arduino can get these data via the I2C interface.
